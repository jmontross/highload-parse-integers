Bandwidth floor (`cat input.txt > /dev/null`, page-cached) ≈ **0.084s** on the ARM
Mac — the f(n)=n asymptote. `run.sh` prints it every run. Champion is memory-bound
(done) when it approaches this. On x86 cloud the floor is noisy (0.2–0.5s); real
floor is ~0.20s. Champion at 0.246s is ~1.2× the real floor.

## Champion
- **avx2_maddubs** — `AVX2 64b block + SSE PMADDUBSW pair-parse` — combines three
  improvements over avx2_blockparse: (1) 64-byte dual-load mask (halves outer
  iterations), (2) fastload parse_num (loads tail-8 digits from `p+len-8`, eliminating
  the two variable-count shifts that bottleneck port 0), (3) SSE PMADDUBSW pair-parse
  processes TWO numbers simultaneously: pack 2 × 8-byte digit tails into a 128-bit
  register, then MADDUBS (levels 1+2) + MULLO + HADD (level 3) produces both 8-digit
  values in ~10 cycles (vs 14 cycles × 2 = 28 scalar). For cnt==6, three independent
  parse_pair calls overlap fully via OOO. **best 0.246s x86 = 4.9 ns/line (23% faster
  than avx2_64b at 0.318s). Submit: `g++ -O3 -march=native`.**
  Local x86: 0.246–0.256s, 3.7× off rank-18 bar (69 ms). Requires AVX2+SSSE3+SSE4.1
  (all implied by __AVX2__). ARM falls back to scalar parse_num.
- **avx2_64b** — `AVX2 64-byte dual-load + count-unroll` — superseded by avx2_maddubs.
  Was champion at 0.318s x86 (10% over avx2_blockparse). Submitted via predecessor at
  rank 119/307ms.
- **v5** — `branchless high digits` — removes the one hostile branch (`h==2`,
  a 10-vs-9-digit coin-flip mispredicting ~47%) by computing the high 0–2 digits
  branchlessly from h∈{0,1,2}. Portable. **best ~0.264s @50M ARM (~28% faster
  than v4)** — branch mispredict was the dominant cost. Promoted via min-of-N
  gate (best AND median lower; 9/9 edge). Now ~2.9× off the bandwidth floor.
  **Judge (submitted 2026-07-03): rank 167/900, 392 ms, score 46,107, g++10.5.0
  `-O3 -march=native`** (up from an early baseline at rank 460 / 749 ms). ~5.7×
  off the rank-18 bar (69 ms) — the AVX2/AVX-512 block parse is what closes it.
  AVX2 block algorithm now VALIDATED on ARM via `-DBLOCK_SCALAR_SIM`
  (`variants/avx2_blockparse.cpp`): same block loop, scalar mask → 50M sum ✓ +
  9/9 edge; only the `vpmovmskb` intrinsic is unexercised locally.
- **v4** — `SWAR nlfind + zero-reload hot path` — on the common 9–10 digit path,
  reconstructs the low-8 parse chunk by shifting the two words already loaded for
  the newline scan (w0,w1) instead of a third `memcpy` — one fewer load per
  number. Portable. **best ~0.368s @50M ARM (~2.6% faster than v3)**, promoted
  via the min-of-N gate (best AND median both lower; 9/9 edge). Judge: _not yet_.
- **v3** — `mmap + SWAR newline-find + SWAR number parse` — drops the per-number
  `memchr` call; derives each newline offset with a SWAR compare over a 16-byte
  window (branch-light, inline). Portable (no intrinsics). **~0.40s @50M ARM
  (~24% faster than v2, 0.533→0.405s)**, promoted through the significance gate
  (Δ ≫ noise band; 9/9 edge cases). Still ~5–6× above the bandwidth floor → AVX2
  is still the next big lever. Judge time: _not yet submitted_.
- **v2** — `mmap + SWAR number parse` — parses a whole number in a short shift/add
  tree instead of a serial multiply per digit. Portable (no intrinsics), ~**0.565s**
  @50M ARM (~11% faster than v1). Still ~7× above the bandwidth floor → AVX2 next.
  Judge time: _not yet submitted_.
- v1 — `mmap + branch-light scalar` — latency-bound on serial `v=v*10+d` (~0.63s @50M ARM). Superseded by v2.

## Tried & dead (don't repeat without a new angle)
- Pure scalar micro-tweaks (branch vs branchless vs memchr) — all ~equal; latency-bound.
- `__builtin_prefetch` ahead of the scan (`swar_prefetch`) — prefetch evicts more
  than it saves; mmap MAP_POPULATE/MADV_SEQUENTIAL already streams optimally.
- 2 numbers/iter with dual accumulators (`swar_unroll2`) — slower; the per-number
  boundary scans are serial (number 2 starts where number 1 ends) so there's no
  independent work to fill the OOO window, and the manual unroll defeated -O3.
  A real latency-hiding win needs a block newline **bitmask** (find all newlines
  in a 32-byte window in one shot, then parse with boundaries already known) —
  which is essentially the AVX2/AVX-512 path. Portable single-thread looks
  latency-capped at ~0.26s on ARM (~2.9× the bandwidth floor).
- **Fixed-shift + cmov in parse_num** (`avx2_cmov`) — computing BOTH 9-digit and
  10-digit chunks and selecting with cmov costs MORE port-0 pressure than one variable
  shift. 33% slower (0.42s vs 0.32s). Don't retry.
- **MADV_HUGEPAGE on file-backed mmap** — THP only works on anonymous mappings;
  MAP_PRIVATE file mmap stays on 4KB page-cache pages regardless. Dead end.
- **avx2_fastload alone** (variable-shift elimination) — 8.8% win, but fully subsumed
  by avx2_maddubs which includes fastload + SIMD pair-parse.
- **PHADDD→PSHUFD+PADDD replacement** (`avx2_nohadd`) — HOLD, not a measurable win.
  HADD is 3-cycle lat/2-cycle tput on Skylake; shuffle+add is 2-cycle lat/1-cycle tput.
  But the 3 independent parse_pairs already saturate OOO; hadd is not the bottleneck.
  Even if hadd is slightly better, the difference is within noise at our current throughput.
- **AVX-512 scan** (`avx512_maddubs`, `avx512_cnt47`) — DEAD on Skylake-SP/Cascade Lake.
  `_mm512_cmpeq_epi8_mask` triggers AVX-512 heavy-use frequency downclocking on this Xeon
  (2.80 GHz → ~2.5 GHz), losing ~10% clock speed. The 5-instruction scan savings (~5%)
  cannot recoup the 10% frequency penalty. Do NOT retry unless on Ice Lake Server or Zen4
  where AVX-512 doesn't downscale frequency.
- **cnt==7 fast path** — not frequently triggered enough to matter at current noise level.

## Status: STOP-FLOOR (2026-07-04)
Champion (avx2_maddubs) best=0.243s on local x86 vs bandwidth floor min=0.193s → 1.26× the floor.
The run.sh STOP-FLOOR gate is triggered (champion < 2× floor). Algorithmic improvements are
exhausted on this hardware. The remaining 26% gap is either compute-inherent overhead or
floor measurement noise. **Submit the champion to the judge to see the real rank.**
- Best submission: `clang++ -O3 -march=native` → 0.242s local best
- Champion is bandwidth-near-bound; on the judge's faster hardware this should translate to
  a much lower absolute time (potentially near rank 18 if judge bandwidth is ~3-4× ours).

## Next hypotheses (if STOP-FLOOR lifts or new hardware)
1. **Submit avx2_maddubs to judge** — local 0.242s (clang). Expected judge time unknown
   (depends on hardware). Previous submission was avx2_blockparse at 307ms/rank119. The
   23% improvement since then should push significantly higher.
2. **AVX2 MADDUBS 4-at-a-time (256-bit parse_quad)** — if we're still compute-bound on
   faster hardware, processing FOUR numbers per 256-bit MADDUBS halves decode pressure.
   Note: adds 3-cycle serial dependency (vinserti128); may or may not help.
3. **VPDPBUSD (AVX-512 VNNI)** — VNNI is present on this CPU (avx512_vnni flag confirmed).
   Could replace MADDUBSW+MADDWD two-level tree. BUT DPBUSD weights max out at int8 (127),
   while digit place values need up to 10000000 — multi-stage DPBUSD needed. Complex.
   Only worth attempting on judge hardware WITHOUT AVX-512 frequency penalty (Ice Lake Server).
4. **Rust port of avx2_maddubs** — Rust's codegen may schedule SIMD loads better.
5. **Reduce newline-scan overhead differently**: instead of AVX-512, try interleaving two
   independent 32-byte scan + parse chains to keep both load ports busy (manual software
   pipelining with 128-byte stride).
