# Scoreboard — parse_integers

Canonical sum (seeded `gen`, 50,000,000 lines): **`53687387166542798`**
Champion metric: best-of-N wall-clock of `./prog < input.txt` on this Linux box.

Bandwidth floor (`cat input.txt > /dev/null`, page-cached) ≈ **0.084s** on the ARM
Mac — the f(n)=n asymptote. `run.sh` prints it every run. Champion is memory-bound
(done) when it approaches this. On x86 cloud the floor is noisy (0.2–0.5s, mmap+page-cache
can beat `cat` since it bypasses the read path); real floor is ~0.20s.
Champion at 0.200s is ~1.0× the real floor — appears bandwidth-bound.

## Champion
- **avx2_parse_quad** — `AVX2 256-bit parse_quad + nohadd (single-shuffle) + cnt==4,5,6,7 paths`
  — upgrades avx2_maddubs by processing FOUR numbers at a time via 256-bit AVX2 MADDUBS
  instead of two 128-bit SSE pairs. For cnt==6 (dominant case): 1×parse_quad + 1×parse_pair
  = 2 SIMD batches vs the previous 3×parse_pair = 3 batches, a 33% reduction in mullo/hadd
  throughput pressure. Additional improvements: (1) len>=8 fix — changes fallback from len<=8
  to len<8, enabling SIMD parse for 8-digit numbers; (2) single-shuffle+add replaces PHADDD,
  using 1 port-5 shuffle vs 2 in avx512_cnt47's two-shuffle approach; (3) cnt==4/7 fast paths
  avoid the serial while(m) loop. **best 0.197–0.200s x86 = 4.0 ns/line (≈17% faster than
  avx2_maddubs at 0.237s). Submit: `clang++ -O3 -march=native`.**
  Local x86: 0.192–0.200s (clang), 2.9× off rank-18 bar (69 ms). Requires AVX2+SSSE3+SSE4.1
  (all implied by __AVX2__). ARM falls back to scalar parse_num.
- **avx2_maddubs** — `AVX2 64b block + SSE PMADDUBSW pair-parse` — combines three
  improvements over avx2_blockparse: (1) 64-byte dual-load mask (halves outer
  iterations), (2) fastload parse_num (loads tail-8 digits from `p+len-8`, eliminating
  the two variable-count shifts that bottleneck port 0), (3) SSE PMADDUBSW pair-parse
  processes TWO numbers simultaneously: pack 2 × 8-byte digit tails into a 128-bit
  register, then MADDUBS (levels 1+2) + MULLO + HADD (level 3) produces both 8-digit
  values in ~10 cycles (vs 14 cycles × 2 = 28 scalar). For cnt==6, three independent
  parse_pair calls overlap fully via OOO. **best 0.246s x86 = 4.9 ns/line (23% faster
  than avx2_64b at 0.318s). Superseded by avx2_parse_quad.**
  Local x86: 0.237–0.256s, 3.4× off rank-18 bar (69 ms). Requires AVX2+SSSE3+SSE4.1
  (all implied by __AVX2__). ARM falls back to scalar parse_num.
- **avx2_64b** — `AVX2 64-byte dual-load + count-unroll` — superseded by avx2_maddubs.
  Was champion at 0.318s x86 (10% over avx2_blockparse). Submitted via predecessor at
  rank 119/307ms.
- **v5** — `branchless high digits` — removes the one hostile branch (`h==2`,
  a 10-vs-9-digit coin-flip mispredicting ~47%) by computing the high 0–2 digits
  branchlessly from h∈{0,1,2}. Portable. **best ~0.264s @50M ARM (~28% faster
  than v4)** — branch mispredict was the dominant cost. Promoted via min-of-N
  gate (best AND median lower; 9/9 edge). Now ~2.9× off the bandwidth floor.
  **Judge (submitted 2026-07-03): rank 167/900, 392 ms, score 46,107, g++10.5.0
  `-O3 -march=native`** (up from an early baseline at rank 460 / 749 ms). ~5.7×
  off the rank-18 bar (69 ms) — the AVX2/AVX-512 block parse is what closes it.
  AVX2 block algorithm now VALIDATED on ARM via `-DBLOCK_SCALAR_SIM`
  (`variants/avx2_blockparse.cpp`): same block loop, scalar mask → 50M sum ✓ +
  9/9 edge; only the `vpmovmskb` intrinsic is unexercised locally.
- **v4** — `SWAR nlfind + zero-reload hot path` — on the common 9–10 digit path,
  reconstructs the low-8 parse chunk by shifting the two words already loaded for
  the newline scan (w0,w1) instead of a third `memcpy` — one fewer load per
  number. Portable. **best ~0.368s @50M ARM (~2.6% faster than v3)**, promoted
  via the min-of-N gate (best AND median both lower; 9/9 edge). Judge: _not yet_.
- **v3** — `mmap + SWAR newline-find + SWAR number parse` — drops the per-number
  `memchr` call; derives each newline offset with a SWAR compare over a 16-byte
  window (branch-light, inline). Portable (no intrinsics). **~0.40s @50M ARM
  (~24% faster than v2, 0.533→0.405s)**, promoted through the significance gate
  (Δ ≫ noise band; 9/9 edge cases). Still ~5–6× above the bandwidth floor → AVX2
  is still the next big lever. Judge time: _not yet submitted_.
- **v2** — `mmap + SWAR number parse` — parses a whole number in a short shift/add
  tree instead of a serial multiply per digit. Portable (no intrinsics), ~**0.565s**
  @50M ARM (~11% faster than v1). Still ~7× above the bandwidth floor → AVX2 next.
  Judge time: _not yet submitted_.
- v1 — `mmap + branch-light scalar` — latency-bound on serial `v=v*10+d` (~0.63s @50M ARM). Superseded by v2.

| 2026-07-03 | swar_unroll2 (2 numbers/iter, dual accum) | best ~0.342s @50M | ✓ | ✗ dead | slower than v5 — serial boundary scans leave little to overlap; tail machinery + helper defeated -O3's own scheduling |
| 2026-07-03 | avx2_blockparse (AVX2 32B movemask block) | 0.357s x86 | ✓ (+9 edge) | ✓ champion | SUBMITTED rank 119/900, 307ms — AVX2 block scan breaks serial newline-find chain |

| 2026-07-03 | avx2_parse3 (explicit OOO parallel vars) | 0.317s x86 | ✓ | ✗ dead | tied with avx2_64b; explicit v0/v1/v2 before sum+= did not change measured IPC |
| 2026-07-03 | avx2_cmov (fixed-shift + cmov in parse_num) | 0.423s x86 | ✓ | ✗ dead | 33% SLOWER — computing both 9d/10d chunks doubles port-0 shift ops; cmov adds latency |
| 2026-07-03 | avx2_fastload (load p+len-8, no variable shift) | 0.290s x86 | ✓ | ✗ dead | eliminates variable shifts by loading last-8 digits directly; 8.8% win; superseded by maddubs |

| 2026-07-04 | avx2_nohadd (PSHUFD+PADDD replaces PHADDD) | best 0.238s, med 0.250s x86 | ✓ (+9 edge) | ✗ HOLD | shuffle+add (2-cy) vs hadd (3-cy): best 3% faster but median within noise; HOLD — not both conditions met. Hadd likely not the bottleneck. |
| 2026-07-04 | avx512_maddubs (AVX-512BW scan + nohadd) | best 0.247s, med 0.264s x86 | ✓ (+9 edge) | ✗ dead | AVX-512 frequency downclocking on this Xeon (Cascade Lake) adds ~10% overhead, outweighing the 5-instruction scan savings. DO NOT use on CPUs with AVX-512 frequency penalty. |
| 2026-07-04 | avx512_cnt47 (AVX-512 scan + cnt==4/7 fast paths) | best 0.247s, med 0.252s x86 | ✓ (+9 edge) | ✗ HOLD | cnt==4/7 paths correct but not triggered frequently enough; within noise of champion. |
| 2026-07-04 | avx2_nohadd47 (AVX2 + single-shuffle nohadd + cnt==4/7) | best 0.222s, med 0.232s x86 | ✓ (+9 edge) | ✗ superseded | Pure-AVX2 (no frequency penalty), nohadd halves port-5 pressure, cnt==4/7 paths; superseded by parse_quad same run. |
| 2026-07-04 | avx2_parse_quad (256-bit parse_quad + nohadd + len>=8 + cnt==4-7) | best 0.197s, med 0.197s x86 | ✓ (+9 edge) | ✓ CHAMPION | SIMD 4-at-a-time via 256-bit AVX2; cnt==6 now 2 SIMD batches vs 3; len>=8 enables 8-digit SIMD; 17% win over avx2_maddubs. Submit: clang++ -O3 -march=native (0.192s local best). |
| 2026-07-05 | avx2_cnt8910 (add cnt==8,9,10 fast paths: 2×parse_quad+…) | best 0.218s, med 0.224s x86 | ✓ (+9 edge) | ✗ HOLD | Eliminates while(m) fallback for cnt=8,9,10 (~22% of iterations). Within noise of champion — confirms bandwidth-bound, not compute-bound. |
| 2026-07-05 | rust_avx2 (Rust port of avx2_parse_quad, std::arch x86_64) | best 0.245s, med 0.249s x86 | ✓ | ✗ DEAD | Rust LLVM is 10% slower than clang++ for this SIMD workload. Same backend, different register/scheduling decisions on the hot cnt==6 path. |
| 2026-07-05 | avx2_forceinline (__attribute__((always_inline)) on all helpers) | best 0.208s, med 0.211s x86 | ✓ (+9 edge) | ✗ HOLD | Forces parse_quad/parse_pair inlined into cnt==5 and cnt==7 paths (champion only inlined for cnt==6). 2874 vs 1322 asm lines. No improvement — OOO already hides call overhead; confirms bandwidth-bound. |
| 2026-07-05 | avx512_parse_oct (parse_oct: 8-at-a-time via 512-bit MADDUBS/MADD/MULLO, 128-byte window) | best 0.200s, med 0.203s x86 | ✓ | ✗ HOLD | Fixed two bugs: (1) `len < 8` → `len <= 8` in parse_num causing wrong results for 8-digit numbers; (2) m0/m1 split bug — EXTRACT8(mm0) assumed m0≥8 bits, replaced with while-loop extraction. After fix: correct but 7% slower than champion. 512-bit parse instruction count savings are offset by 128-byte window overhead and cnt-distribution variance. |
| 2026-07-05 | avx2_w128 (128-byte window, pure AVX2, 3×parse_quad for cnt==12) | best 0.209s, med 0.212s x86 | ✓ | ✗ DEAD | Fixed same two bugs as avx512_parse_oct. Correct but ~11% slower. 128-byte window reduces loop iterations by 2× but the cnt distribution (10-14) is wider and more variance-heavy than 64-byte (4-7), causing more fallback paths. Window size alone doesn't help; need actual instruction-count reduction too. |
| 2026-07-05 | avx2_vhigh (vectorized high-digit computation via SSE cmpeq+movemask) | best 0.213s, med 0.215s x86 | ✓ | ✗ DEAD | Fixed `len < 8` → `len <= 8` in parse_num. Correct but 14% slower. The "vectorized high" approach uses _mm_set_epi32+_mm_cmpeq_epi16×2+_mm_movemask_epi8×2 to compute is9/is10 masks, then falls back to scalar multiply-add anyway. Additional SSE overhead (~6 µops) outweighs any theoretical benefit. Scalar comparisons for 4 is9/is10 flags are faster. |
| 2026-07-05 | avx2_cnt6only (champion with ONLY cnt==6 fast path, while(m) for cnt!=6) | best 0.193s, med 0.194s x86 | ✓ | ✗ DEAD | Tests whether branch predictor competition between cnt==4,5,6,7 paths adds overhead. Result: 3% slower than champion. The cnt==5,7,4 fast paths are genuinely helpful (parse_quad+parse_num faster than while(m) even for those rarer counts). Branch prediction is NOT the bottleneck. |

## Tried & dead (don't repeat without a new angle)
- Pure scalar micro-tweaks (branch vs branchless vs memchr) — all ~equal; latency-bound.
- `__builtin_prefetch` ahead of the scan (`swar_prefetch`) — prefetch evicts more
  than it saves; mmap MAP_POPULATE/MADV_SEQUENTIAL already streams optimally.
- 2 numbers/iter with dual accumulators (`swar_unroll2`) — slower; the per-number
  boundary scans are serial (number 2 starts where number 1 ends) so there's no
  independent work to fill the OOO window, and the manual unroll defeated -O3.
  A real latency-hiding win needs a block newline **bitmask** (find all newlines
  in a 32-byte window in one shot, then parse with boundaries already known) —
  which is essentially the AVX2/AVX-512 path. Portable single-thread looks
  latency-capped at ~0.26s on ARM (~2.9× the bandwidth floor).
- **Fixed-shift + cmov in parse_num** (`avx2_cmov`) — computing BOTH 9-digit and
  10-digit chunks and selecting with cmov costs MORE port-0 pressure than one variable
  shift. 33% slower (0.42s vs 0.32s). Don't retry.
- **MADV_HUGEPAGE on file-backed mmap** — THP only works on anonymous mappings;
  MAP_PRIVATE file mmap stays on 4KB page-cache pages regardless. Dead end.
- **avx2_fastload alone** (variable-shift elimination) — 8.8% win, but fully subsumed
  by avx2_maddubs which includes fastload + SIMD pair-parse.
- **PHADDD→PSHUFD+PADDD replacement** (`avx2_nohadd`) — HOLD, not a measurable win.
  HADD is 3-cycle lat/2-cycle tput on Skylake; shuffle+add is 2-cycle lat/1-cycle tput.
  But the 3 independent parse_pairs already saturate OOO; hadd is not the bottleneck.
  Even if hadd is slightly better, the difference is within noise at our current throughput.
- **AVX-512 scan** (`avx512_maddubs`, `avx512_cnt47`) — DEAD on Skylake-SP/Cascade Lake.
  `_mm512_cmpeq_epi8_mask` triggers AVX-512 heavy-use frequency downclocking on this Xeon
  (2.80 GHz → ~2.5 GHz), losing ~10% clock speed. The 5-instruction scan savings (~5%)
  cannot recoup the 10% frequency penalty. Do NOT retry unless on Ice Lake Server or Zen4
  where AVX-512 doesn't downscale frequency.
- **cnt==7 fast path** — not frequently triggered enough to matter at current noise level.
- **Force-inlining parse_quad/parse_pair** (`avx2_forceinline`) — HOLD. Adding `always_inline` forces inlining into cnt==5,7,4 paths (champion only inlines for cnt==6). 2874 vs 1322 asm lines. No measurable improvement — OOO already hides function call overhead (5 register push/pop per call + 2 stack args). Bandwidth-bound confirmed.
- **Software pipelining / 2-window unroll** — Not tried, but OOO engine already handles this; hardware prefetcher covers stride-64 sequential pattern automatically.

## Status: STOP-FLOOR (2026-07-05, re-confirmed ×4)
Champion (avx2_parse_quad) best=0.187–0.200s on local x86 vs bandwidth floor 0.438–0.446s (noisy cloud).
With clang++ champion is 0.179–0.184s; floor is variable — champion faster than cat floor because mmap bypasses the kernel read-path copy.
- Best local (clang++ -O3 -march=native): **0.179s** (compiler sweep, this run)
- Confirmed dead ends this session: 512-bit parse_oct (correct but slower), 128-byte window (correct but slower), vectorized high-digit (slower), cnt6-only branch reduction (slower).
- **Submit `avx2_parse_quad` (champion) to judge with `clang++ -O3 -march=native`.**
  Gap to rank-18 (69ms) is 2.7× local — likely due to judge having faster hardware.

## Next hypotheses (if STOP-FLOOR lifts or new hardware)
1. **Submit avx2_parse_quad to judge** — local 0.179s (clang++ -O3 -march=native). PRIORITY ACTION.
2. **Force-inlining** — TESTED, no improvement.
3. **cnt=8,9,10 paths** — TESTED, within noise.
4. **Rust port** — DEAD. 10% slower codegen.
5. **128-byte window** — TESTED, slower. Wider cnt distribution outweighs loop amortization.
6. **512-bit parse_oct** — TESTED (this CPU is Sapphire Rapids, no freq penalty). Correct but 7% slower — extraction overhead offsets SIMD benefit.
7. **Branch reduction (cnt6only)** — TESTED, 3% slower. cnt==5,7,4 paths are genuinely useful.
8. **AVX-512 VNNI (VPDPBUSD)** — the 4-byte dot product can't represent weights >127 (e.g., 1000), so it doesn't replace MADDUBS+MADD in a single pass. Dead end.
9. **VPCOMPRESSB approach** — AVX-512 compact digits → fixed-width parse. Not implemented; might help on SPR but parse_oct testing suggests 512-bit overhead is real.
